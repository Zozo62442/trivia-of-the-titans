# Trivia of the Titans

**Trivia of the Titans** is a command-line Python quiz game that tests your knowledge of mythology using randomly generated questions from the Open Trivia Database. The player answers 10 mythological questions and gets their final score at the end.

### Project Goals

The goal of this project is to create an interactive and educational Python quiz application that allows users to test their mythology knowledge in a fun and engaging way. The quiz fetches dynamic questions from the Open Trivia Database and validates user responses. The app is modular, allowing for scalability and easier maintenance, and is deployed on Heroku for accessible use through a browser-based terminal.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to play a quiz game about mythology.
- As a user, I want the questions to be different every time I play.
- As a user, I want to choose from multiple-choice answers and receive feedback if my input is incorrect.
- As a user, I want to see my score at the end of the game.
- As a user, I want a clean and readable terminal experience.
- As a developer, I want to keep my code organized using modules.

## Flowchart
- Using Canva I made a flowchart based on the requirements, the user stories and project goals:

## How to Play

- Launch the app in the terminal.
- Choose to begin the mythological quiz.
- You‚Äôll be asked **10 random mythology-themed questions**.
- For each question, select the correct answer from multiple choices.
- At the end, your score will be revealed!

Questions are pulled dynamically from [OpenTDB](https://opentdb.com), making each game different!

## Technologies Used

### Languages Used
- **Python**

### Programs & Tools Used
- **Heroku**: For app deployment using Code Institute's mock terminal.
- **PEP8 Linter**: To ensure Python code style and formatting consistency.
- **Online IDE Syntax Checker**: Used to manually check syntax and logic.
- **Code Institute Terminal**: Cloud-based terminal used during development.
- **Gitpod**: Cloud-based IDE.
- **ASCII generator** [patorjk](https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=Graffiti&t=Type%20Something%20)

### Python Libraries & Modules
- **requests**: For making API calls to the Open Trivia Database.
- **random**: Used to shuffle multiple choice answers.
- **os**: For clearing the terminal screen for a cleaner UI.
- **html**: To unescape special characters from HTML-encoded trivia questions.


---

## Data Model

- Uses the **Open Trivia Database API** to fetch quiz questions.
- Each API response includes:
  - `question` (text)
  - `correct_answer`
  - `incorrect_answers` (list)
- These are combined and shuffled before being shown to the user.

---

### Code Organization

To improve readability, maintainability, and scalability, the Python codebase was split into multiple files:

- `run.py` ‚Äì Main program that starts the app.
- `api.py` ‚Äì Handles API requests and parsing.
- `utils.py` ‚Äì Contains helper functions like screen clearing and input validation.
- `game.py` ‚Äì Controls the core game logic and user flow.

This approach follows standard Python modular programming practices, as explained in this helpful [DataCamp article on Python Modules](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/modules-in-python).

---

## Testing

### Manual Tests
- Placed the individual section of the code in PEP8 CI Linter and no errors were detected.
- Tested in an online IDE python syntax checker [ONLINE IDE](https://www.online-ide.com/online_python_syntax_checker)

### PEP8 Validation

I passed all my files through the [Code Institute Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) of which all but one gave back no errors. The remaining one I was not able to correct on time.

## Bugs

### Solved Bugs
- **Heroku Deployment Issues**:  
  I experienced several difficulties getting the app running on Heroku. Despite having the correct `requirements.txt`, `Procfile`, and buildpacks, the deployment initially failed. With support from both my mentors, we used a variety of methods to debug the issue:
  - Carefully inspected Heroku logs via the Heroku dashboard and `heroku logs --tail` command.
  - Installed the Heroku CLI in my local VS Code environment to run detailed diagnostics and view error output in real-time.
  - Compared my setup to working examples.
  - Double-checked environment variables (Config Vars) and ensured they matched the expected format and values.
  Eventually, the app was successfully deployed after adjusting several configurations based on these troubleshooting methods.

### Remaining Bugs

- None known at this time.

## üöÄ Deployment

This project is deployed using Code Institute‚Äôs mock terminal for Heroku.

### Deployment Steps:

## üöÄ Deployment on Heroku

The project was deployed using [Heroku](https://heroku.com) with Code Institute's mock terminal template.

### Prerequisites
Ensure the following files are present in your repository:
- `requirements.txt` ‚Äì lists all required Python dependencies.
- `Procfile` ‚Äì tells Heroku how to run the app (e.g., `web: python run.py` or similar).
- `runtime.txt` ‚Äì specifies the Python version.
- `index.js` ‚Äì included as part of the Code Institute Heroku deployment template to keep Heroku's dyno alive.
- `creds.json` ‚Äì if using APIs requiring credentials (optional, set as Config Var).

---

### Deployment:

1. **Create a Heroku Account**  
   Go to [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login) and sign up or log in.

2. **Create a New Heroku App**

     - First, select **Python** and click **Save Changes**.
     - Then, add **Node.js** and click **Save Changes** again.
   - **Python must be listed above Node.js**. You can drag them to reorder if needed.

4. **Configure Environment Variables (Config Vars)**  
   - Still under **Settings**, click **"Reveal Config Vars"**.
   - Add any needed environment variables:
     - For example:
       - **Key:** `PORT` ‚Üí **Value:** `8000`
       - If using external APIs (e.g., Google Sheets): add `CREDS` and paste your `creds.json` content.

5. **Connect GitHub Repository to Heroku**
   - Navigate to the **Deploy** tab.
   - Under **Deployment method**, choose **GitHub**.
